#Simple wallet example for Lyra

Note:

1) send/receive or any transactional operation must be kept in serial for a wallet. parallel transaction operations will fail randomly.
2) multiple wallet can run in parallel. transaction in one wallet don't affect others.
3) please keep in mind don't open wallets which have the same private key twice. 
4) a wallet file stores only private key and DPoS vote info. A balance refreshing is needed before any transaction.
5) Wallet.SendOnce will return immediately if failed. Wallet.Send will retry for 20 seconds if failed. this will cover times when network is in view change state.
